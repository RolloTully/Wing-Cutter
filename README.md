# Wing-Cutter
A program that generates g-code designed to drive a 4 axis hot-wire cutter, the code automatically and dynamically adjusts cutting paths to account for errors occuring due to the cutting width of the wire and its dependance on cutting rates.

The current program can accuratley cut foils as thin or thinner than 6mm with chords of 150mm assuming all parameters are corretly set, the current chord error is +5mm, the thickness error is unknown
