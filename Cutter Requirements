This software is currently only designed to cut airfoils(but can be bodged to cut other profiles if needed)

The software requires(The bare minimum)
-The .dat or .txt file containing containing your continuious, normalised airfoil profiles 
-The root and tip chord lengths[mm].
-The Root and tip twists[degrees](if present, in degrees)
-The wing section span[mm](max 600mm, 700mm if we push it, this is an exception).

Optionaly:
-Chord twist position[%], this is the point about which the airfoil profile is rotated expresed as a percentage of the foil chord
-Wing tip displacment[mm], this program does not support sweep angles

Additonal info:
currently(this will be fixed soon) both airfoil but have the same number of data points if you are using different airfoils at the root and tip.
the airfoil data must be continuious(the points must be expressed sequentialy) and normalised(values between 1 and 0), these will also be addressed soon.
